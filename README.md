TravisLight
===========
Let's try Travis CI first

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/willdurand/TravisLight.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willdurand/TravisLight)

TravisLight is a build monitoring tool, also known as buildwall, that
allows you to quickly detect failing projects hosted on
[GitHub](http://github.com) and tested using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
by providing a nice web interface.

This application has been written using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/),
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), and
[Lo Dash](http://lodash.com/).
